# AudioSynthesizer

Do you want to make music but lack the musical keyboard to do so? Do you want the option of NOT 11 NOT 12 BUT 13 whole notes to play?  
Not enjoying the current octave? Well here, here's NINE of them.  
"Haha there's no way I could change the attack, delay, sustain or release of these notes lol"  
Think again buddy, all of them are configurable.  
"Well fine but I'm only stuck with 1 wave type"  
That's where you're wrong hot stuff, enjoy up to FOUR wave types.
